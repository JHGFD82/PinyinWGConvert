# PinyinWGConvert (to be renamed)

## Origin
This project is an attempt to reproduce the syllable_count function used in conjunction with the Tang History Database, helmed by Anna Shields, Professor of East Asian Studies, Princeton University. The eventual goal is to package the process of syllable analysis and make it publicly available as a Python package. This code originally appears as a Jupyter Notebook, with additional drafting notes in a separate project.

## Features
The main function analyzed romanized Chinese text and compared the number of syllables to supplied Chinese text. The original goal was to validate text entry of names of Chinese figures during the Tang dynasty. With time, more features were included such as error catching, detection of romanization systems Pinyin and Wade-Giles, and translation between both systems individually and within English text.

## Goals
1. Translate Jupyter Notebook code into modules.
2. Verify working order of all original features.
3. Make publicly available.
4. Field requests from community for more features.
